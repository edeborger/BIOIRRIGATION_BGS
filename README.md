# Readme bioirrigation model.

This repository contains model code for the bioirrigation model used to fit continuous tracer measurements.

The file "bioirrigation_fitting_example.Rmd" contains examples of how to fit the bioirrigation model to a tracer time series.
The script "bioirrigation_fitting_functions.R" contains the cost funtion used to fit parameter values.
The package "irrfit.tar" contains the actual model.

Explanation of the model itself can be found in the accompanying article:
